## Ananya Harsh Jha

Hi! I’m a second-year PhD student at the University of Washington, co-advised by [Luke Zettlemoyer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lsz/) and [Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/).
I am interested in the theory of machine learning and continuous optimization.<br />

Previously, I was a [predoctoral researcher](https://allenai.org/predoctoral-young-investigators) at [AI2](https://allenai.org/), where I was mentored by [Emma Strubell](https://strubell.github.io/) and [Iz Beltagy](https://beltagy.net/).<br />

Before that, I was a research engineer at [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning).
I co-wrote [TorchMetrics](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/torchmetrics) with [Teddy Koker](https://teddykoker.com/) and worked on [stochastic-autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12329.pdf) with [Kyunghyun Cho](https://www.kyunghyuncho.me/).<br />

In a previous life, I worked on [cycle-VAEs](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Ananya_Harsh_Jha_Disentangling_Factors_of_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf) with [Saket Anand](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~anands/) at [IIIT-Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/).<br />

## resources

- 📜 You can find my grad school statement of purpose at [CS-SOP](https://cs-sop.notion.site/CS-PhD-Statements-of-Purpose-df39955313834889b7ac5411c37b958d?p=2dda63bcbc8a4650bf41845f08dbb666&pm=s).
I hope this is helpful to you. Also, remember that graduate students come from diverse backgrounds, and your profile need not look like mine to be accepted into the same program.
